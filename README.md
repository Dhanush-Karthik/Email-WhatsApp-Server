# Emails on WhatsApp

## **ABSTRACT**
  
  * Email is slowly loosing its users in recent times. As of 2010, the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009. 
  
  * Also a 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email.
  
  * Which shows that young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media over emails.
  
  * Since the usage of emails are declining over time among young people, we are demonstrating that the problem can be formulated by sending emails through popular instant messaging applications and also it helps to re-establish emails. 
  
  ## **INTRODUCTION**
  
  * The purpose of this project is to design an automation bot using WhatsApp where we can send mails consisting of text. Since the usage of emails are declining over time
  
  * Young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media.
  
  * Thus incorporation of instant messaging apps and emails can solve this problem.
  
  * Sending mails in WhatsApp is much easier because we spend most of the time on WhatsApp and not switching to another app can save us time and it also facilitates in user flexibility. 
  
  ## **EXISTING SYSTEM AND IT’S DRAWBACKS**
  
  * **Existing System :**
  
        Email
  * **Drawbacks :**
  
        Email is slowly loosing its users in recent times. 
  
  ## **STATS**
    
   * Email is slowly loosing its users in recent times.
   
   * As of 2010, the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009. For persons 12 to 17, the number was down 18 percent. Young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media.
   
   * A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email

 ## **PROPOSED SYSTEM**
  
  * Nowadays, Young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media
  * A 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email
  * We therefore propose a novel method that accepts the message to be sent in email as text from WhatsApp , a popular instant messaging platform and send that as mail.
  * Sending mails in WhatsApp is much easier because we spend most of the time on WhatsApp and not switching to another app can save us time at the same time it helps to re-establish emails.

## **CONCLUSION**

  * In this work we have presented an approach for designing an automation bot using WhatsApp where we can send mails consisting of text.
  
  * Since the usage of emails are declining over time, we demonstrated that the problem can be formulated by sending emails through popular instant messaging applications.

  * We could further improve the project by adding features like sending images , audios , videos and documents.
